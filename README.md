UDACITY MYREADS APP PROJECT

MYREADS APP PROJECT
This is Derek Ayres' MyReads project, a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books using drop down menus as "Currently Reading," Want to Read," "Read," and "None." The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

REQUIREMENT:
npm


INSTALLATION AND RUNNING
1. Download or Clone the repository from GitHub: https://github.com/derekayres/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git

2. In the console, run:

  npm install  - to install the project dependencies

  npm start - to run and serve the project locally

3. The app can be seen in in the browser at:

  localhost: 3000

BACKEND SERVER
The project is developed against a backend server that is accessed through a BookAPI.js file contained in the project folder.

IMPORTANT
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
